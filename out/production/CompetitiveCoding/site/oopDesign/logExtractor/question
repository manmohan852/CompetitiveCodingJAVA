Introduction

Live services generate logs at very high rate. E.g. our service generates over 100,000 log lines a second.
Normally, these logs are loaded inside databases for fast query,
but the cost of keeping all the logs becomes too high, and for this reason,
we keep logs in 2 locations. 1. Databases 2. Files In our case we use single file
and append all the log to this file as we get logs from our servers.
Since this file is sitting on large network file storage system,
the size of this file can easily grow to 100s of TB.

Problem Statement We need a Log extractor, that will extract loglines from desired timeframe.
 The inpfut to this program will be "From Time" "To Time" "Log file location",
  the time formats will be "ISO 8601" format. Also the time range will be few minutes at max,
  i.e. you will only be extracting at max few million lines of logs.
   The extraction process should complete in few seconds minimizing engineer's wait time.

Log file format 1. The log file has one log per line. 2.
 Every log line will start with TimeStamp in "ISO 8601" format followed by comma (','). 3.
 All the log lines will be separated by single new line character '\n'.
