The java.util.PriorityQueue.poll() method in Java is used to retrieve or fetch and remove the first element
of the Queue or the element present at the head of the Queue.

The peek() method only retrieved the element at the head but the poll() also removes the element
along with the retrieval. It returns NULL if the queue is empty.
